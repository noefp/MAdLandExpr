Vegetative Chara braunii S276 cultures were cultivated at 21°C with a light intensity of 50-60 μmol photons m−2 s−1 under a 16 h light: 8 h dark cycle. 
Cultivation under ambient air conditions (0.04% CO2) was defined as a low-inorganic carbon (LC) condition.
To evaluate response to fluctuating inorganic carbon conditions, medium of the algae (LC) was exchanged with high-inorganic carbon medium (HC, 10 mM NaHCO3). Both HC and LC algae were acclimated for 7 d, after which the liquid medium was exchanged with the respective other (HC to LC and LC to HC) and thalli samples sans rhizome collected 24 and 48h after the shift. Poly(a)+ selected cDNA libraries were generated via service using the Illumina TruSeq stranded protocol and paired-end sequenced using 2x100 bp read length. 
Data analysis was performed on the European instance galaxy server: reads were trimmed via cutadapt, mapped and counting of reads was performed using RNA STAR and time series gene expression analysis (HC to LC and LC to HC) was performed using DESeq2.
<br>Samples are based into two replicates normalized to ???.
