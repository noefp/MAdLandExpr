Vegetative Chara braunii S276 cultures were pre-cultivated at 21°C with a light intensity of 50–60 μmol photons m−2 s−1 under a 16 h light: 8 h dark cycle. To evaluate osmoregulatory ability, the alga was then incubated for 6, 24, and 48 h at an elevated salinity of 5 PSU sea salt and whole thalli without the rhizome were harvested. Poly(a)+ selected cDNA libraries were generated via service using the Illumina TruSeq stranded protocol and paired-end sequenced using 2x100 bp read length. 
Data analysis was performed on the European instance galaxy server: reads were trimmed via cutadapt, mapped and counting of reads was performed using RNA STAR and time series gene expression analysis was performed using DESeq2.
<br>Samples are based into two replicates normalized to TPM.
