      Vegetative Chara braunii S276 cultures were kept at 22°C in a 16 h light: 8 h dark cycle with white light lateral illumination (30–70 μmol photons m−2 s−1). 
      Nodal cells were cut out and pooled from several algae and total RNA extracted from both pooled nodal cells and a whole thallus. 
      Poly(a)+ selected cDNA libraries were generated via service and sequenced on an Illumina NextSeq 500 system using 75 bp read length. 
      Data analysis was performed on the European instance galaxy server: reads were trimmed via cutadapt, mapped and counting of reads was performed using RNA STAR.

      Samples are based into one replicate normalized to TPM.

    <p>Figure on right: Specimen of <i>Chara baunii</i>. Detailed view of Chara braunii S276. Shown is the area with the interior node cells confined by two internodal cells. Nodal cells pinched off peripheric cells from which branchlets developed with a structure analogous to the main stem consisting of branchlet nodal and internodal cells. Branchlet nodal cells are the origin for the development of antheridia (shown) and the typical charophytic oogonia after proliferation.</p>
